## chicken biryani
Chicken Biryani is altogether a bowl full meal consisting carbohydrates,protines and fiber.It has potential to fulfill all the requirements of a full meal single handedly.It's colourful appearance,rich garnishing,great aroma,mouth watering taste makes it more tempting.**Tasty masala and juicy meat** are the showstopper,and they decide the taste of biryani.That is why it is my favorite.
