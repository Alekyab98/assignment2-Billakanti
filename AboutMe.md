# Alekya Billakanti
My name is Alekya and I am a computer engineer.I graduated from KITSW last year,My favorite subjects at university were all the once related with software development.The main reason I am passionate about developing is so i can leverage my creativity, because there are so many ways to achieve the same goal when you code software and I like to find the optimal for every scenario.
